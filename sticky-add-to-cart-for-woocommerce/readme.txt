The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window which includes the product name, price, rate, stock status and everything that hold significance.



== Description ==
Products, these days are more diverse than ever before. The trend too is to club altogether in one place, in one page for easy availability.

Some products have long descriptions, reviews, galleries etc. When you finish reading such you often find the add to cart button getting hidden at the top of the page on the screen. The problem becomes equally irritating when you have committed to a product and want to purchase it. No, Not anymore!

The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window which includes the product name, price, rate, stock status and everything that hold significance.

The content bar swiftly and subtly slides down into normal view from above once the standard add to cart has scrolled out of view. Now your customers donâ€™t have to bear the headache of hunting the cart anymore to add the products they choose!!
