The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window which includes the product name, price, rate, stock status and everything that hold significance.


== Description ==
Products, these days are more diverse than ever before. The trend too is to club altogether in one place, in one page for easy availability.

Some products have long descriptions, reviews, galleries etc. When you finish reading such you often find the add to cart button getting hidden at the top of the page on the screen. The problem becomes equally irritating when you have committed to a product and want to purchase it. No, Not anymore!

The WooCommerce Sticky Add to Cart plugin displays a mini content bar at the top of the browser window which includes the product name, price, rate, stock status and everything that hold significance.
